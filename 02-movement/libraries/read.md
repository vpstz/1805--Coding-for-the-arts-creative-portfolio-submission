The following project is a ball that would bounce inside the box, whenever the ball hits the boarder the color of the ball will change along with the background. The following project is inspired by the moving DVD logo that would change color whenever it hits the corner of the boarder, however with my current skills it is rather difficult for me to figure it out how to precisly change the color when it hits the corner of the wall.
