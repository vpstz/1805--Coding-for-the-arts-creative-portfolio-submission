The following project is inspired by the mouse drawing excercise B in week 4 of the lecture.
In my project however, instead of making colorful sphere I went for a more interactive approach that allows the user to create their minimalistic artwork by aloowing the user to, adjust the size of their brushes, erace their drawing and even saving their art work to their own computer. 

Controls 
Toggle Brush 1 = 1
Toggle Brush 2 = 2
Toggle Brush 3 = 3

p.s brushes overlap one another, simply toggling the bigger brush allows you to continue drawing with the smaller brush 

Erase On/Off = q/e
save art = s
